    <string name="step0text">Welcome! We will try to demonstrate different views of yourself and the world, and why it\'s important to consider these.</string>
    <string name="step1text">This is how you see yourself, how you want to present yourself to others or how others see you.</string>
    <string name="step2text">This is what you see, how you are to yourself.</string>
    <string name="step3text">When you see yourself or when you pay attention to how others see you, your mind is mostly turned inward. Suddenly your mind is a barrier to directly experiencing the world.</string>
    <string name="step4text">When you are yourself, you are free, open, a space for the world. Sights, sounds, tastes, smells and touches happen within you.</string>
    <string name="step5text">If you pay attention to your mind when you\'re interacting with people and when you\'re thinking and not thinking, you will see what a difference this makes.</string>
    <string name="step6text">Thank you for participating in this exercise!</string>
